        It is a system which contains longer conversation audio clips, either

        You will be listening to the dialogue that will likely contain multiple

        If overlapping speech is occurring: the segment boundaries should be
        accurate with at least 100milliseconds precision, if possible.

      <p class="block_12">
        If overlapping speech is NOT occurring, the segment boundaries do not
        have to be 100% precise but should start and end within
        85-100milliseconds from when the speaker begins/ends their speech. The
        boundaries should not overlap with the same speaker turn next to the
        segment. Speaker turns should not contain pauses in speech that are
        longer than 0.5 seconds. If a speaker does pause their speech for longer
        than 0.5 seconds, end the speaker turn before the pause then create a
        new turn for when the speaker resumes talking.

      <p class="block_12">
        All speaker labels should be consistently formatted. Speaker labels
        should always: be in all lowercase, be spelled correctly, and should not

        you from submitting incorrect formats.

        new segment must be created if a single segment intends to run for
        longer than 30 seconds.
